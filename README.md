Hi there 👋

 💻⚡ I'm an aspiring frontend developer who is constantly improving my skills in JavaScript and React. 
In addition to that, I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. 
I can create the visual part of a project based on visualizations, for example, in Figma.

💡 📚	I acquire knowledge from courses available on udemy.com, scrimba.com, and tworcastron.pl. 
I'm open to learning and exploring new technologies.

✨As part of my learning journey, I have created several applications that are available on my profile.
